## Overview

### Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal Portfolio. This project was built with Sass/scss and JavaScript.

The projects are dynamically generated, using Class and Objects with JavaScript.

The class is created using a constructor with these parameters: title, image, imageAlt, description and link.

The objects are in an Array of Objects so it can easily be accessed an configured.
